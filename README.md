# Chatbot-Implementation-Using-NLP
AICTE Internship Project
## Overview
This project involves creating an AI-powered chatbot that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to comprehend and respond to user inquiries in an intelligent manner. The chatbot identifies various intents from user input and provides appropriate responses. The system employs the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing and scikit-learn to build a machine learning model for intent classification.

## Key Features
‚úÖ Text processing based on NLP using NLTK

‚úÖ Intent recognition to categorize user input

‚úÖ Predefined responses mapped to different intents

‚úÖ Machine learning-based response prediction

‚úÖ Console-based interactive chatbot

‚úÖ Simple to customize with different intents and responses

## Technologies Used
Python üêç

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Scikit-learn (TF-IDF Vectorizer & Logistic Regression)

NumPy & Pandas

JSON for training data

## How It Works
Data Preparation: The chatbot is trained on a dataset that includes various intents, user input patterns, and corresponding responses (stored in a JSON file intents.json).

Text Preprocessing: The user's input is tokenized, stemmed, and vectorized using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique.

Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is used to classify user input into one of several predefined intents.

Response Generation: Based on the intent identified by the model, the chatbot selects and provides an appropriate, predefined response.
